We would suggest to you that you need to consider how to show development of students' skills in a practical subject such as PE and not focus solely on communication. Really aim to reflect the realities of the subject and awareness of how to assess development in order to give a fuller picture and stronger chance at any future interviews.","course_full":false,"they_offered_you_a_place_on_another_course":false,"honesty_and_professionalism":false,"information_given_on_application_form_false_or_inaccurate":false,"evidence_of_plagiarism_in_personal_statement_or_elsewhere":false,"references_didn_t_support_application":false,"safeguarding_issues":false,"information_disclosed_by_candidate_makes_them_unsuitable_to_work_with_children":false,"information_revealed_by_our_vetting_process_makes_the_candidate_unsuitable_to_work_with_children":false,"visa_application_sponsorship":false,"additional_advice":false,"future_applications":false}
