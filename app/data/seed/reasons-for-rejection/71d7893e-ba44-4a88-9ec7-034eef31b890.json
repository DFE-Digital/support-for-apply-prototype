Unfortunately we are not offering you a placement for next September for the following reasons.\n\nYou did not demonstrate that you have a realistic view of what is involved in the role of a teacher or in teacher training.  The panel felt that you underestimated the knowledge and skills that you will need to develop to be a successful teacher.  On more than one occasion you expressed a belief that all you need to develop is classroom management skills as you already can do everything else.\n\nYour passion for Maths is clear although the panel found that your lesson & delivery style was not as engaging as they would have expected for someone as passionate as Maths as you are.  The panel queried if you would truly be able to relate to a student who struggles with Maths or dislikes it.\n\nI am sorry this is not the news you were hoping for.  We wish you every success in the future."}
