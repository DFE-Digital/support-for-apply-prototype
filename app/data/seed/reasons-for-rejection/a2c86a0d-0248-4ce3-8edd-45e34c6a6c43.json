Unfortunately we have received many applications for our primary course this year and applications have to be of a very high standard to be successful at the shortlisting stage. Both referees make a point in saying that they cannot comment on your suitability to work with children. It would therefore have been better had you chosen your volunteer position at Paper Plane Productions for one of your references."}
