Openly admitted had no knowledge of primary education and this was evident in responses whereby some questions were not attempted at all. Presentation lacked depth and clarity of understanding and felt paraphrased from the internet.  \n\nCandidate should be advised to volunteer initially and perhaps explore the role of TA for a year before embarking on any ITT routes."}
