Awareness of teaching at certain levels was not evident in Clara's answers.  Clara's lesson activity was structured and showed planning, but had not taken into account the details of organisation that would have impacted on it.   Overall, Clara did not show a clear understanding of the wider, full role of a teacher, given all that they have to do in their working life."}
