Unfortunately we have decided not to offer you a training placement for September.  The reasons for this are as follows.\n\n\nWe felt that you were passionate about going into teaching but that you were not realistic about what is involved in teacher training and how time consuming it can be.  Neither did you demonstrate that you are wholly familiar with the education system in the UK making references to classes of fifteen when, in the maintained sector, classes of thirty students are typical.  \n\n\nYou did not seem to recognise that your lesson plan was far too ambitious for a fifteen minute session which surprised the panel as you are used to planning art lessons for your art clubs.  When asked what your key learning points were, you made no reference to locating red cedar trees which was one of the points of focus of your lesson plan. \n\n\nIf you are able to address the issues raised over the next academic year, then we would be happy to accept an application from you to train in teach in 2022."}
