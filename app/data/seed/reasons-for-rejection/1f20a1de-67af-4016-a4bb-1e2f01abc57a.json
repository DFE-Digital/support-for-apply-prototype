I spoke with the candidate on the phone at length and suggested her application was much stronger for primary. We chatted about her options and her lack of awareness of secondary education, secondary qualifications and secondary classrooms. She likes maths, but all of her experience is in primary. She intends to get some experience and exposure to secondary schools next year.","performance_at_interview":false,"course_full":false,"they_offered_you_a_place_on_another_course":false,"honesty_and_professionalism":false,"information_given_on_application_form_false_or_inaccurate":false,"evidence_of_plagiarism_in_personal_statement_or_elsewhere":false,"references_didn_t_support_application":false,"safeguarding_issues":false,"information_disclosed_by_candidate_makes_them_unsuitable_to_work_with_children":false,"information_revealed_by_our_vetting_process_makes_the_candidate_unsuitable_to_work_with_children":false,"visa_application_sponsorship":false,"additional_advice":true,"future_applications":false}
